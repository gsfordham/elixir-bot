# ElixirBot

## Description

Gonna try to rewrite my old Python bot, but this time in Elixir. Partially using this as a learning project

## TODO

1) Use JSON to configure it
1) Rebuild my old utility commands
1) Rebuild my old moderator commands
1) Rebuild my old admin/bot-owner commands
1) Figure out how to do music with Nostrum
1) Rebuild that complex multi-server DJ controller with autoplay and stuff that I had, before DiscordPy redid their API...
1) Rebuild my meme-spouting spambot functions, but maybe a bit less annoying, this time...
1) Rebuild all those random game things I previously had...
1) Try not to shoot myself through the brainstem with a 12-gauge shotgun, as I think about how much I will need to redo to get this bot on par with the PyBot from like 2 years ago
1) Add some sort of server data storage units -- possibly a regular database, maybe just JSON files... IDK -- never did this for the PyBot, but I was originally planning to
